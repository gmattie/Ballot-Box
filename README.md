## **Installation**

Install package dependencies for both the `./server` and `./client`:

```
cd server
npm install
```

```
cd client
npm install
```

## **Database**

This application requires a **MongoDB** document-oriented database.

Please goto https://mongodb.com/ to register for your own database.

## **Environment**

Both the `./server` and `./client` directories must contain `.env` files in order to connect to your database, sign and verify JSON Web Tokens for user authentication and to send emails for user registration and password update confirmation.

#### **Server**

Please refer to the `./server/.envTemplate` file to see the key/value pairs that must be included in `./server/.env`:

```
#
# Components of the database URL with embedded credentials.  Special characters must be URL encoded.
#
# Example:
#
# DB_PASSWORD = "password12345"
# DB_PATH = "ballotbox.mongodb.net/params"
# DB_PROTOCOL = "mongodb+srv"
# DB_USERNAME = "ballotbox"
#
DB_PASSWORD = ""
DB_PATH = ""
DB_PROTOCOL = ""
DB_USERNAME = ""

#
# Private key for signing and verifying JSON Web Tokens.
#
# Example:
#
# JWT_PRIVATE_KEY = "abc123def456ghi789"
#
JWT_PRIVATE_KEY = ""

#
# Configuration of the outgoing email.
#
# Example:
#
# EMAIL_ADDRESS = "no-reply@ballotbox.com"
# EMAIL_CLIENT_ID = "12345"
# EMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET = "secret12345"
# EMAIL_NAME = "Ballot Box"
# EMAIL_REFRESH_TOKEN = "refreshToken12345"
#
EMAIL_ADDRESS = ""
EMAIL_CLIENT_ID = ""
EMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET = ""
EMAIL_NAME = ""
EMAIL_REFRESH_TOKEN = ""
```

#### **Client**

Please refer to the `./client/.envTemplate` file to see the key/value pairs that must be included in `./client/.env`:

```
#
# JSON Web Token authorization for development environment
#
# Example:
#
# REACT_APP_DEV_JWT = "abc123def456ghi789"
#
REACT_APP_DEV_JWT = ""
```

## **Development**

Run the **server** and/or **client** from the root directory to test your code:

```
npm run server
```

```
npm run client
```

## **Deployment**

This application is setup to use the **Heroku** cloud platform as a service (PaaS).

Please goto https://heroku.com/ to register for your own account.

After registration:

- Create a new Heroku app
- `App > Settings > ` add `Config Vars` that match the key/value pairs in `./server/.env` (without the quotes)
- `App > Deploy > ` Connect your new Heroku app to your GitHub repo and deploy
